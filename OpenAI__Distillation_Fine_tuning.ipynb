            "2. **Game Management**: The referee manages the flow of the game, including starting and stopping play, managing substitutions, and ensuring the game is played within the designated time limits.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Safety**: The referee is responsible for player safety, ensuring that the game is played in a non-contact manner and addressing any dangerous play or misconduct.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Communication**: The referee communicates decisions clearly to players and team officials. This includes signaling penalties, explaining rulings, and managing any disputes or queries that arise during the game.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Positioning**: The referee maintains optimal positioning to observe play effectively, ensuring they can make accurate decisions and maintain control over the game.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Advantage Rule**: The referee applies the advantage rule, allowing play to continue if the non-offending team is in a favorable position, rather than stopping the game for minor infringements.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Scoring**: The referee is responsible for confirming and recording scores, ensuring that tries are awarded correctly.\n",

            "Yes, there are several differences between touch rugby and rugby union, as they are distinct forms of rugby with different rules and gameplay characteristics. Here are some of the key differences:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Contact**: \n",
            "   - **Touch Rugby**: As the name suggests, touch rugby is a minimal-contact sport. Instead of tackling, players stop the progress of the ball carrier by touching them with their hands. This makes the game safer and more accessible to a wider range of participants.\n",
            "   - **Rugby Union**: Rugby union is a full-contact sport where players tackle opponents to the ground to stop their progress. This involves a higher level of physicality and requires protective gear like mouthguards.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Team Size**:\n",
            "   - **Touch Rugby**: Typically played with six players on each team.\n",
            "   - **Rugby Union**: Played with 15 players on each team in the traditional format, although there are variations like rugby sevens which have seven players per team.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Field Size**:\n",
            "   - **Touch Rugby**: The field is generally smaller, about 70 meters long and 50 meters wide, which is roughly half the size of a rugby union field.\n",
            "   - **Rugby Union**: The field is larger, up to 100 meters long and 70 meters wide.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Scoring**:\n",
            "   - **Touch Rugby**: A try is scored by grounding the ball over the opponent's try line, similar to rugby union, but there are no conversions, penalties, or drop goals.\n",
            "   - **Rugby Union**: Points can be scored in several ways, including tries, conversions, penalty kicks, and drop goals.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Game Duration**:\n",
            "   - **Touch Rugby**: Games are usually shorter, often played in two halves of 20 minutes each.\n",
            "   - **Rugby Union**: Matches are typically 80 minutes long, divided into two halves of 40 minutes each.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Set Pieces**:\n",
            "   - **Touch Rugby**: There are no scrums or lineouts. Restarting play is done with a simple tap of the ball.\n",
            "   - **Rugby Union**: Features complex set pieces like scrums and lineouts, which are integral parts of the game.\n",
